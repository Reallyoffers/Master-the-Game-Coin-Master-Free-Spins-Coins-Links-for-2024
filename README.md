For attacks, choose villages with no shields or ones that are actively being upgraded for maximum impact.  

### **3. Complete Card Sets**  
Card collections are an underrated way to earn spins and coins. Completing card sets rewards you with:  
- Free spins.  
- Bonus coins.  
- Rare items.  

Trade duplicate cards with friends or in Coin Master communities to complete your sets faster.  

### **4. Use Pets Strategically**  
Pets provide significant bonuses:  
- **Foxy**: Increases coins earned during raids.  
- **Tiger**: Boosts rewards from attacks.  
- **Rhino**: Shields your village from attacks.  

Feed your pets to keep them active during gameplay, especially during events.
